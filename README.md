# Predictions with Markov Chains

This JS application multiplies a probability vector with a transition matrix multiple times (<i>n</i> steps - user defined). On each step, the values from the resulting probability vectors are plotted on a chart. The resulting curves on the chart indicate the behavior of the system over <i>n</i> steps. Note that the application allows a prediction for systems with a maximum of 13 states. However, more states can be added. The application has no dependencies and can be used as a single offline html file. Note that the construction and theory behind the chart of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc/World-smallest-js-chart-v1.0).
