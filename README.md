# Predictions with Markov Chains
Predictions with Markov Chains on an unlimited number of states

Mode: Java Script (native)

Dependencies: none (one file app)

The application multiplies a probability vector with a transition matrix multiple times (<i>n</i> steps - user defined). On each step, the values from the resulting probability vectors are plotted on a chart. The resulting curves on the chart indicate the behavior of the system over <i>n</i> steps. Note that the application allows a prediction for systems with a maximum of four states.

This subject of pseudo-random numbers is related to a philosophical discussion from the book entitled <i>Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Theory and Implementation</i>. Note that the construction and theory behind the chart of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc/World-smallest-js-chart-v1.0).
